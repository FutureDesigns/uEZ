Upstream LWIP contains the following folders:
  * src
  * doc
  * test
  * contrib (currently in separate package until future 2.2.X release)

You must fill out files in the following folders to implement the required functions for the higher level software and RTOS:
  * Include
  * system (mainly sys_arch.c)

Note that the "arch" folder possibly contains just an older example of these files. If so the contrib->examples folder will contain more up to date examples.
Then the "arch" folder will be removed in some future uEZ release after review of it.

There is still some incomplete integration especially for RTOS functions and some thread related defines that weren't used before (possibly they didn't exist before).
Some of this was included to allow per-thread semaphore and better working core locking but without complete testing.
In the contrib->examples there is a more complete FreeRTOS example. Bringing in more functions and defines from that might allow more features to work.
To use some features for non-included files more include paths may need to be added to the tool chain, such as for the IPV6 folder. (both in library and application project)
A signification rework would be needed to avoid this so we may explore trying to read includes from a file in the future if possible. As then you could pull in the file instead of having to manually update all projects.

The following files are modified from upstream lwip. When updating the modifications will need to be kept.
  * tcpip_init -> pass up thread creating handle to check for sucess or out of memory
  * tcp.h
  * tcpip.h
  * tcpip.c
  * lwip/memp.h -> added .network section for pools
  * netif/ethernetif.c -> uEZ integration (some of what is here may be able to be moved out in the future)
  * src/include/lwip/opt.h	Has changes to default settings that probably affect behaivor, should be able to move them in the future.
