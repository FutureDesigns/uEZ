SEGGER emWin Tools Version 6.32b for use with emWin v6.32+
For emWinSPY run "CopyJlinkDll.bat" to copy over the latest JLink dll from the standard installation path.

Note that the new movie creation exe tool appears to be missing from this NXP release. As uEZGUIs lack HW JPEG decoder the uEZ video player should be faster than emWin video player.

For Linux run the corresponding script file to launch the program.
All SEGGER Launch scripts will create a new SEGGER prefix in: /.local/share/wineprefixes/
