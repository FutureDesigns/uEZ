To use Tracealyzer Trace Recorder Library please get the latest version and put the c files into this folder, and headers into the Include folder.

Currently it will be up to the end-developer to make sure that integration and RTOS Config settings are correct to be able to run Tracealyzer. Some require settings/hooks are not present in uEZ.

See www.percepio.com and the FreeRTOS website for details.
