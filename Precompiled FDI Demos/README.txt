Each folder contains .bin files from IAR/Crossworks/KEIL/HEW builds for the respective FDI development kits.
These are the standard demo projects. In some cases only the IAR project contains the emWin demo.

To program them please install the latest JLink drivers then run the associated .jlink script file with JLink.exe.

For the LPC1788 and LPC4088 IAR builds, please use the "Install App and NOR Flash IAR.bat" file to program the unit as it is a multi-step process.
