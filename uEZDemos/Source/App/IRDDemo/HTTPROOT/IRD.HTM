LPC1768 Industrial Reference Design (IRD) is a platform targeted at RTOS based 
embedded applications.&nbsp; Designed around a flexible “Core” and “Base” pcb boards, 
it features many of the functions and wired communications protocols found in 
today’s embedded applications. The flexible design allows for changing of core 
and base boards, displays and keypads as needed by the targeted application.&nbsp; It 
also features flexible power supply options. Software development and debug is 
easily accomplished with the use of the JTAG connection, and 
In-System-Programming (ISP) circuitry.</font></p>

version 1.2 kit features an LPC1768 core board, an 
NXP designed base (green pcb), a phone style keypad board, and a 140x32 pixel 
Noritake vacuum florescent display.&nbsp; The platform is enabled with Future Designs' 
uEZ<sup>tm</sup> with FreeRTOS (RTOS), and provides software support for 10/100Base 
Ethernet, USB Host, RS232, and I<sup>2</sup>C wired 
communication protocols.&nbsp; Additionally, the platform can be powered from an 
external 5VDC power supply, or from a Power Over Ethernet (POE) Device 
application board.</font></p>
