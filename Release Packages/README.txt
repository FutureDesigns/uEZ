Each folder contains .bin files from IAR/Crossworks/KEIL/HEW builds for the respective FDI development kits.
These are the standard demo projects. In some cases only the IAR project contains the emWin demo.

To program them please install the latest JLink drivers then run the associated .jlink script file.

For the uEZGUI-1788 IAR builds, please use the "Install App and NOR Flash IAR.bat" file to program the unit.
For uEZ 2.06, JLink ARM v454 and JLink-RX 456a were tested.
